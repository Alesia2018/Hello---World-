What is a branch?
A branch is something that keeps your flow of ideas organized and together. 

What is a commit?
A commit keeps up with your progress on GitHub. This includes deleting, adding, and editing. It also creates a history of your workflow so when others review your work, they can follow along to every step you made and why you made it. 
 
What is the purpose of the Pull Request? 
The pull request leaves comments or discussions about the commits made in the program. This means the program created is ready for viewing and critiquing.
